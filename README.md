# The Social Network Project.                   

##This project is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.  

##The purpose of this project is to learn several technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications.

##I am learning the Mongo database.

##This is a work in progress project but once completed, I will deploy this in MongoDB Atlass and Heroku.

##Code used this far came partly from the mini project from the class activities.
